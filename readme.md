High resolution (14,000 x 19,000) renders of [Folded Faces](https://opensea.io/collection/foldedfaces) by GenLight.

Files are split into maximum 100MB chunks to fit within GitHub limits.

Use the [website](https://octal.art/folded-faces-high-resolution) to combine the chunks into a single PNG file.

Alternatively, use `get-images.sh` to generate PNGs for all pieces. Or combine the chunks on the command line:

Windows cmd:
```cmd
type 172.aa 172.ab 172.ac > 172.png
```

Linux/Mac:
```sh
cat 172.aa 172.ab 172.ac > 172.png
```
